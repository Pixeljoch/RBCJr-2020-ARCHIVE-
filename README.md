## About The Project

We're a team of young developers from a school in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, and we have always been interested in robotics. 
After some time, we decided that we were ready for building our first competitive robot. We loved the awesome vibe that we got at the events and never stopped developing robots. This year (originally last year but Covid decided to pop around ðŸ˜‰), we are combining forces with a different school from the area, creating a team that is playing for all schools that are part of the Meerwegen Scholengroep. Stick around and be sure to check out our codebase if you're interested. Keep an eye out, we'll see you at the event :)

### Built With

Our robot would'nt've made it without these guys, check them out! Thanks everyone for letting us use your products :)
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
* [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
* [Corderius College](https://corderius.nl)
* [Leaphy](https://leaphy.nl)
* [Meerwegen Scholengroep](https://meerwegen.nl)
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

## Getting started

Want to get started with your Soccerbot? Use this information and code away! Do note that this codebase ONLY works on Windows devices. We're hoping to extend to other platforms in a later state.

### Prerequisites

In order to utilize our codebase, please make sure that you have your robot at hand, assembled and ready to go (indicator lights illuminate green). Please connect your robot to your device.

### Installation
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's free.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and [install PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
3. Create a new project and open your terminal using Ctrl+`
4. Clone our repository by typing the following command in the terminal:
   `
   git clone https://gitlab.com/radiolivestreams/RBCJr-2020.git
   `
5. In the file manager (Visual Studio Code), expand the new folder. It contains our codebase.
6. Code away!

By the way, if you want to upload the code to your robot, try running the following command in the terminal: 
`
pio run -t upload
`
